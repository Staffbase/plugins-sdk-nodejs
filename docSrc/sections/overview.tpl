If you are developing your own plugin for your Staffbase app we describe the authentication flow of a plugin at https://developers.staffbase.com/api/plugin-sso/. While this documentation just covers the conceptual ideas of the interface of plugins though – the so called Plugin SSO – we want to provide a library to help you develop your first plugin for Staffbase even faster. This SDK provides the basic functionality to parse and verify a provided token for Node.JS.
